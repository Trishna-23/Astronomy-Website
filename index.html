      <p>Humans have been studying the stars for millennia, since the time of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. By studying astronomy, we have learned how to nagivate through uncharted territories and keep track of time by looking at the phases of the moon. And despite not having all of the answers, we've been able to answer many questions about our origins and place in the universe.</p>
      
      <p>As humanity has progressed, so has our interest in the cosmos, and with new technology came new ideas about how the universe was formed and organized. However, not all ideas were welcomed with open arms. Some astronomers and scientists faced ridicule and were even arrested for their ideas. Galileo for example, was sentenced to life imprisonment until his death in 1642 for his idea that our solar system was heliocentric. Despite this, many of the ideas that were originally rejected have been proven correct, usually after the death of said astronomer.</p>
        
      <p>Additionally, all of these discoveries raise new questions--why are we so invested in exploring space and learning about astronomy? What do we have to gain by studying the cosmos so intensely? The answers to these questions vary depending on the person, but our interest in the cosmos is most likely a result of our desperation to figure out our purpose in the universe, and whether or not we are truly alone in the vast expanse of space that we call home.</p>

      <p>Although the average person cannot explore space in person, our website's goal is to help you on your journey through space. Here you can learn about the stars, planets, black holes, etc. from the comfort of your own planet. So take the plunge and dive into astronomy by clicking through the navigation bar at the top of each page!</p>
