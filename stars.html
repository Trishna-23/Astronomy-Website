  <p>Humanity has been mapping the stars for thousands of years, using them to guide their travels. Groups of stars have even been assigned to constellations, which form patterns in the shape of something recognizable. And stories about these stars and constellations vary from culture to culture. In ancient Greece for example, the constellation of Orion was said to have been a great hunter that was immortalized in the sky after his death. This is one of the most recognizable constellations and is visible all around the world.</p>
  <p>There are many different kinds of stars throughout our universe and each of them go through different stages during their lifetime, which can range from millions of years to billions of year depending on their size and how much fuel they have left.</p>

  <h2>Star Formation and Life Cycle</h2>

  <p>Stars are formed in giant clouds of dust, better known as a nebula. When enough dust gathers in one area, gravity begins to pull it together and it will eventually collapse under its own weight. As this is happening, the middle of this little ball begins to heat up as well and forms the protostar which will become a main sequence star. The process of star formation can take around one million years, which is nothing compared to the life cycle of stars.</p>
  <p>Some of the nebulae where stars are formed were created by dying stars, whose explosive death resulted in materials being spewed out everywhere. This 'star dust' is continously recycled and will form new generations of stars after a star has died. Matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed and so everything in the universe today is simply recycled material from billions of years ago, including you. These giant explosions, called supernovae, are also how heavier elements are created. The explosions spew out a large amount of energy and heat, thus allowing elements heavier than iron, such as gold, to form.</p>
  <p>Stars can also swell or contract in size and change color throughout their lifetime, resulting in a new kind of star being formed. More massive stars can also collapse under their own weight and form neutron stars, or if they have enough mass they will become black holes.</p>

  <h2>Red Giants</h2>

  <p>Red giants are stars that are dying as they have burned through most of their fuel and rather than fusing hydrogen into helium, they fuse helium into carbon. These stars form when main sequence stars run out of hydrogren in their cores and gravity begins compressing the star inwards. The star then bloats up to hundreds of miles in diameter. Which leads to their color becoming more orange-red as the heat is spread out over a larger surface area.</p>
  <p>Stars that have entered the red giant phase of their life can last around one billion years before entering the next phase, when it will contract and compress into a white dwarf.</p>
