  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Humanity has been mapping the stars for thousands of years, using them to guide their travels. Groups of stars have even been assigned to constellations, which form patterns in the shape of something recognizable. And stories about these stars and constellations vary from culture to culture. In ancient Greece for example, the constellation of Orion was said to have been a great hunter that was immortalized in the sky after his death. This is one of the most recognizable constellations and is visible all around the world.</p>
  <p>There are many different kinds of stars throughout our universe and each of them go through different stages during their lifetime, which can range from millions of years to billions of year depending on their size and how much fuel they have left. Although there is a lot to learn about stars, here is a quick overview of five types of stars.</p>
