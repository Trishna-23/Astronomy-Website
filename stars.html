  <p>Humanity has been mapping the stars for thousands of years, using them to guide their travels. Groups of stars have even been assigned to constellations, which form patterns in the shape of something recognizable. And stories about these stars and constellations vary from culture to culture. In ancient Greece for example, the constellation of Orion was said to have been a great hunter that was immortalized in the sky after his death. This is one of the most recognizable constellations and is visible all around the world.</p>
  <p>There are many different kinds of stars throughout our universe and each of them go through different stages during their lifetime, which can range from millions of years to billions of year depending on their size and how much fuel they have left.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:right;">Star Formation and Life Cycle</h2>

  <p style="text-align:right;">Stars are formed in giant clouds of dust, better known as a nebula. When enough dust gathers in one area, gravity begins to pull it together and it will eventually collapse under its own weight. As this is happening, the middle of this little ball begins to heat up as well and forms the protostar which will become a main sequence star. The process of star formation can take around one million years, which is nothing compared to the life cycle of stars.<br></br>
  Some of the nebulae where stars are formed were created by dying stars, whose explosive death resulted in materials being spewed out everywhere. This 'star dust' is continously recycled and will form new generations of stars after a star has died. Matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed and so everything in the universe today is simply recycled material from billions of years ago, including you. These giant explosions, called supernovae, are also how heavier elements are created. The explosions spew out a large amount of energy and heat, thus allowing elements heavier than iron, such as gold, to form.<br></br>
  Stars can also swell or contract in size and change color throughout their lifetime, resulting in a new kind of star being formed. More massive stars can also collapse under their own weight and form neutron stars, or if they have enough mass they will become black holes.</p>
  <br></br>

  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Main Sequence Stars</h2>
  
  <p style="text-align:left;">Main sequence stars are defined as any star that fuses hydrogen to helium in its core and has stable outward pressure from the core. This means that 90% of stars in our universe are main sequence stars due to the broad definition that encompasses a wide variety of stars into this category.<br></br>The mass of a main sequence star is also an important factor in determining its life span; massive stars may have more material but the gravitational force inwards causes the core of the star to burn at a higher temperature. Resulting in a shorter life span since the star burns more material at a faster rate. An example of a main sequence star is a red dwarf, these small stars aren't very big or bright but their life span is roughly 80-100 billion years. This is because their core temperature is significantly lower than other stars, meaning they don't burn as much fuel to stay alive compared to massive stars.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:right;">Red Giants</h2>

  <p style="text-align:right">Red giants are stars that are dying as they have burned through most of their fuel and rather than fusing hydrogen into helium, they fuse helium into carbon. These stars form when main sequence stars run out of hydrogren in their cores and gravity begins compressing the star inwards. The star then bloats up to hundreds of miles in diameter. Which leads to their color becoming more orange-red as the heat is spread out over a larger surface area.<br></br>Stars that have entered the red giant phase of their life can last around one billion years before entering the next phase, when it will contract and compress into a white dwarf.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:left;">Dwarf Stars</h2>

  <p style="text-align:left">Dwarf stars come in many different colors like red, white, and brown; these stars have relatively very little mass and appear dimmer than other stars. Additionally, they make up most of the main sequence stars since red dwarfs are the most common type of star in our universe. However, brown dwarf stars will never truly become stars because they do not have enough mass for the materials in their core to fuse. For a brown dwarf star to begin fusing elements, it needs to be at least 80 times as massive as Jupiter.<br></br>Red dwarf stars on the other hand are technically counted as stars and are the most common type throughout the universe. They have a low mass and use very little fuel, and as a result they are dimmer than the average star but also have longer lifespans. Even the most massive red dwarf star can live up to tens of billions of years while their smaller counterparts can live for more than trillions of years!<br></br>Despite their name, yellow dwarf stars are not actually dwarfs and are simply medium sized main sequence stars--the sun for example is classified as a yellow dwarf. The name is just a way to differentiate them from giant yellow stars such as Psi Andromedae in the constellation of Andromeda.</p>
  
  <h2 style="text-align:right;">Neutron Stars</h2>
  
  <p style="text-align:right">Neutron stars are formed when massive stars can no longer fuse elements and collapse, but only stars with a core 1-3 times the mass of the sun will become a neutron star and more massive stars will form black holes. These stars are the densest objects in the universe because the once massive stars collapse to only the size of a city!<br></br>Although neutron stars do not give off much radiation compared to other stars, they have very strong magnetic fields and some are called pulsars because they rotate rapidly and give off pulses of radiation in short, regular intervals.</p>
