  <p id="one">There is a seemingly endless variety of planets that we can learn about, including the planets in our own solar system; from the rocky surfaced planet that we call home to the gas giant planet Jupiter with winds of up to 400 mph. Unfortunately, we don't have enough time for that, so here's an overview of some of the different types of planets scattered throughout our universe.</p>
  <p id="one">Of the 8 planets in our solar system--The Milkyway Galaxy--there are three main types of planets that can be found. These planets all vary in size, climate, color, etc.</p>

   <h2 id="tr">Terrestrial Planets</h2>
      
    <img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ab49d751b9747207000cde25c1a1d4b4-lq" style="float: left; margin-left: 360px;" id="me">
      
    <p id="two">These planets are the most rugged of the three types. It has a very rocky surface that is made up mostly of silicate, rocks, and metals. These planets all have metal cores and a silicate mantle. Their surface is made up of canyons, mountains, craters, volcanos, etc. There are four total planets in our solar system that are identified as Terrestrial Planets by the IAU: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are our solar system's inner planets, aka the closest to the sun.<br><br>
    Terrestrial planets have significant atmospheres, but each contain different gases. This is caused by a difference in temperature, mass, size, formation, and presence of life. The only planet of the inner planets to not have an atmosphere is Mercury.<br><br>
    Despite a lack of an atmosphere, Mercury is the 2nd hottest of the planets in our solar system, only beat by Venus. It is the closest planet to the sun, and only takes about 87 earth days to complete a full orbit, which is the shortest orbit of the planets. Mercury is also the smallest of our planets after pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.<br><br>

    <p id="three">
    Venus is the 2nd closest planet to the sun, and the hottest planet in our solar system. The reason it has an overall higher temperature is because, unlike Mercury, Venus has an atmosphere. This atmosphere helps to absorb heat and keep it within the planet, causing temperatures to rise higher. <br><br>
    Although Mercury is more consistantly closer to Earth during its orbit, Venus is the planet in our solar system that comes the closest to Earth, reaching about 24 million miles from Earth. Despite Mercury's constant close proximity to Earth, Mars actually comes in 2nd on terms of how close each planet gets to Earth, with about a 33.9 mile distance. <br><br>
    Majority of the planets in our solar system spin counter-clockwise. This is why the sun rises in the east, and sets in the west. However, Venus roatates clockwise, meaning the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east on Venus.<br><br>

    <p id ="four">
    Earth is the 3rd planet from the sun in our solar system. It is currently the only planet that is known to have life. Venus has recently been discovered to have a toxic atmosphere, which could be a sign that life is, or at least was, on Venus. This, however, is not definitive evidence. Therefore, as far as we know, we are still alone in our solar system.<br><br>
    While there is plenty of water to be found in our solar system, Earth is the only known planet to have water on its surface. Other planets like Neptune and Uranus are covered in ice, but have no liquid water. Jupiter and Saturn are both gas giants, so their water source is the gas that they're made from. As for our fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury and Mars are both believed to house smaller amounts of water, and in different forms, than Earth. Venus, however, has an extremely low amount of water, which is the main reason the planet is uninahbitable.<br><br>
    Our home planet is also the only planet in our solar system that isnt refered to as a roman god. While technically, the name "earth" roots from the Latin word "terr", which means "earth" and is the word that led to the name "Terra" for the roman goddess of the Earth, we still refer to our planet by its english version.<br><br>

    <p id ="five">
    Mars is the second smallest planet of our solar system, and the 4th planet from the sun. It is known as the "Red Planet" because of the color that comes from the planet being covered in rock and sand. However, Mars hasn't always been a giant wasteland. There have been signs of ancient floods on Mars that suggest that it used to house bodies of water like rivers, and oceans. The only water that can be found on Mars today is from icy dirt and thin clouds.<br><br>
    Mars has two moons: Phobos and Deimos. Both are believed to have been caught in Mars' orbit billions of years ago. But Mars might soon become a one moon planet, as Phobos has been getting closer to Mars every hundred years. In 50 million years, Phobos is set to either crash into Mars, or break up into a ring before it is able to reach the planet. <br><br>
    Mount Everest is known as the largest mountain on Earth. The largest mountain on Mars, Olympus Mons, is more than 3 times Everest's height, going about 16 miles high. It has a diameter of 374 miles, which covers about the same amount of land as Arizona. <br><br><br><br>

    <h3 id="gg">Gas Giants</h3>

      Next are the gas giants of our solar system: Jupiter and Saturn. A gas giant is a planet that has no hard surface, but instead consists of a centered core with gases circling said core. These planets mostly consist of hydrogen and helium, and have a very low density. The first gas giant of the milkyway, and the 5th planet from the sun, is Jupiter. <br><br>
      Known as the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter has a radius of about 43,441 miles. This is almost 11 times Earth's radius, which is about 3,958 miles. Its great size can be attributed to the fact that Jupiter is also one of the oldest planets in our solar system. Both Mars and it were formed about 4.6 billion years ago, while Earth and the rest of the planets formed about 4.5 billion years ago. <br><br>
      Jupiter has also been found to have the shortest days of any planet in our solar system. It only takes Jupiter about 10 hours to make a full spin about its axis, while it takes Mercury around 1,408 hours, and Venus about 5,832 hours. Although, the other planets are all within the usual 10-25 hour day period, Mercury and Venus being the large outliers. <br><br>

    <p id="seven">
      The 6th planet from the sun is Saturn. This planet is known for its outer rings, it having the biggest and brightest of our solar system. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune all have rings as well, however theres are much smaller and less bright, so its not as easy to see theirs as it is Saturn's. <br><br>
      The rings that these planets have are made up of asteroids, comets, etc. when they pass too close to the planets orbit, and end up being broken down for doing so. <br><br>
      Saturn is known as the farthest planet that can be seen by the naked eye. However, what we think we see Saturn as isn't exactly what it looks like. Both Saturn and Jupiter are actually not perfectly spherical. Both have a buldge along their equators that give them a more oval shape compared to other planets.<br><br><br><br>

    <h3 id="ig">Ice Giants</h3>

    <img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/73449/original/image-20150302-5236-19u573n.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip" style="float: left; margin-left: 310px;" id="ur">

    <p id="eight">
      The 7th planet from the sun, and the coldest planet in our solar system, is Uranus. Despite not being the farthest planet from the sun, uranus still holds the spot for the coldest planet, with its coldest temperature being recorded as 371.56 degrees fahrenheit. It is widely believed that billions of years ago, something large hit Uranus and caused it to be at the tilt it's at today. The ice giant is currently considered to be on its side, and because of this, it releases a lot more heat then it retains, unlike most other planets. <br><br>
      Although it isn't fully clear when humans first saw any planets outside of our own, the first time one was recorded, and thus considered the first planet discovered by humans, is Uranus. On March 13, 1781, William Herschel was performing a survey of all magnitude 8 stars, and happened to spot Urnaus while doing so.<br><br>
      Out of all the planets in our solar system named after gods, Uranus is the only one to be named after a Greek god. All of the other planets have the names of Roman deities. Uranus, however, comes from the greek god of the sky, meant to be the personification of heaven. He is the son & husband of Gaea, and Zues' grandfather.<br><br>

    <p id="nine">
      The 8th planet from the sun, and the windiest, is Neptune. The highest winds recorded on this distant planet is 1,200 mph. Thats faster than the speed of sound on Earth, and is the fastest winds recorded in our galaxy. Average winds on Neptune tend to be around 700 mph, which is still impressive considering its still faster than the speed of sound on Earth. <br><br>
      The discovery of this windy planet was very different from the other planets of the solar system. While other planets were typically observed, Neptune was actually calculated. Astronomers had found that Uranus' orbit had certain disruptions in it, and with certain calculations made, they predicted the location of planet Neptune.<br><br>
      Neptune's odd discovery might also be attributed to the fact that it, and Uranus, are the only planets in our solar system unable to be seen by the naked eye. All of the other planets in our solar system can be seen at certain times, however Uranus and Neptune are too distant to be observed by anyone who doesn't have the correct equipment to do so. <br><br><br><br>
