  <p id="one">There is a seemingly endless variety of planets that we can learn about, including the planets in our own solar system; from the rocky surfaced planet that we call home to the gas giant planet Jupiter with winds of up to 400 mph. Unfortunately, we don't have enough time for that, so here's an overview of some of the different types of planets scattered throughout our universe.</p>
  <p id="one">Of the 8 planets in our solar system--The Milkyway Galaxy--there are three main types of planets that can be found. These planets all vary in size, climate, color, etc.</p>

    <p id="two">These planets are the most rugged of the three types. It has a very rocky surface that is made up mostly of silicate, rocks, and metals. These planets all have metal cores and a silicate mantle. Their surface is made up of canyons, mountains, craters, volcanos, etc. There are four total planets in our solar system that are identified as Terrestrial Planets by the IAU: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are our solar system's inner planets, aka the closest to the sun.<br><br>
    Terrestrial planets have significant atmospheres, but each contain different gases. This is caused by a difference in temperature, mass, size, formation, and presence of life. The only planet of the inner planets to not have an atmosphere is Mercury.<br><br>
    Despite a lack of an atmosphere, Mercury is the 2nd hottest of the planets in our solar system, only beat by Venus. It is the closest planet to the sun, and only takes about 87 earth days to complete a full orbit, which is the shortest orbit of the planets. Mercury is also the smallest of our planets after pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.<br><br>

    Venus is the second closest planet to the sun, and the hottest planet in our solar system. The reason it has an overall higher temperature is because, unlike Mercury, Venus has an atmosphere. This atmosphere helps to absorb heat and keep it within the planet, causing temperatures to rise higher. <br><br>
    Although Mercury is more consistantly closer to Earth during its orbit, Venus is the planet in our solar system that comes the closest to Earth, reaching about 24 million miles from Earth. Despite Mercury's constant close proximity to Earth, Mars actually comes in 2nd on terms of how close each planet gets to Earth, with about a 33.9 mile distance. <br><br>
    Majority of the planets in our solar system spin counter-clockwise. This is why the sun rises in the east, and sets in the west. However, Venus roatates clockwise, meaning the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east on Venus.<br><br>

    Earth is the third planet from the sun in our solar system. It is currently the only planet that is known to have life. Venus has recently been discovered to have a toxic atmosphere, which could be a sign that life is, or at least was, on Venus. This, however, is not definitive evidence. Therefore, as far as we know, we are still alone in our solar system.<br><br>
    While there is plenty of water to be found in our solar system, Earth is the only known planet to have water on its surface. Other planets like Neptune and Uranus are covered in ice, but have no liquid water. Jupiter and Saturn are both gas giants, so their water source is the gas that they're made from. As for our fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury and Mars are both believed to house smaller amounts of water, and in different forms, than Earth. Venus, however, has an extremely low amount of water, which is the main reason the planet is uninahbitable.<br><br>
    Our home planet is also the only planet in our solar system that isnt refered to as a roman god. While technically, the name "earth" roots from the Latin word "terr", which means "earth" and is the word that led to the name "Terra" for the roman goddess of the Earth, we still refer to our planet by its english version.<br><br>

    <p id ="five">
    Mars is the second smallest planet of our solar system, and the 4th planet from the sun. It is known as the "Red Planet" because of the color that comes from the planet being covered in rock and sand. However, Mars hasn't always been a giant wasteland. There have been signs of ancient floods on Mars that suggest that it used to house bodies of water like rivers, and oceans. The only water that can be found on Mars today is from icy dirt and thin clouds.<br><br>
    Mars has two moons: Phobos and Deimos. Both are believed to have been caught in Mars' orbit billions of years ago. But Mars might soon become a one moon planet, as Phobos has been getting closer to Mars every hundred years. In 50 million years, Phobos is set to either crash into Mars, or break up into a ring before it is able to reach the planet. <br><br>
    Mount Everest is known as the largest mountain on Earth. The largest mountain on Mars, Olympus Mons, is more than 3 times Everest's height, going about 16 miles high. It has a diameter of 374 miles, which covers about the same amount of land as Arizona. <br><br><br><br>
