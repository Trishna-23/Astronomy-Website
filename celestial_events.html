    <h2>Meteor Showers</h2>
    <p>Meteor showers happen when pieces of space matter enter Earth’s atmosphere and burn up in a streak of light, they’re commonly known as shooting stars because of this. Meteors are commonly composed of oxygen, silicon and heavier metals such as iron and nickel; they can be mostly iron or stone, and some are a combination of both. The earliest recorded meteor shower was the Lyrids, and it dates back to 687 B.C. in China.</p>

    <p>The annual Geminid meteor shower can be viewed anywhere around the world, and special equipment is not needed to view this spectacular event. The 2020 Geminids will be especially eye-catching because the sky will be darker thanks to the new moon. This meteor shower will be active from December 4th to the 17th, but is expected to peak around the 13th or 14th. The best time to watch the Geminids will be at 2am local time according to EarthSky authors Bruce McClure and Deborah Byrd, because “that’s when the shower’s radiant point – the point in our sky from which the meteors seem to radiate – is highest in the sky.” The Geminids get their name from the Gemini constellation, where they appear to radiate from.<br></br>According to NASA, the Geminids appear annually as Earth passes through a massive trail of debris left by a weird object named 3200 Phaethon. Phaethon was first thought to have been an asteroid but is now classified as an extinct comet. Extinct comets don’t have ice like regular comets because of one too many close encounters with the sun.<br></br>The Geminids first appeared in the mid-1800s but weren’t noteworthy because there were only 10-20 meteors per hour. The meteor shower grows stronger every year and they peak at 120 meteors per hour now. At first no one knew where the Geminids came from but after NASA’s Infrared Astronomy Satellite spotted 3200 Phaethon, astronomer Fred Whipple made the connection when he realized both followed nearly identical orbits. The Geminids tend to appear yellow, green, or blue in color and go by quickly.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:right;">Solar Eclipse</h2>
    <p style="text-align:right;">A solar eclipse occurs when the moon is inbetween the Earth and the sun, casting a shadow over Earth and making it appear as though the sun is a ring. Solar eclipses can be partial or total and typically occur 2-5 times a year, with total eclipses occurring around every 18 months or so. A total eclipse can last up to 8 minutes but are typically shorter.<br></br>The ring is known as the corona and is just the outer part of the sun that isn't hidden behind the moon. Astronomers and people througout history have observed solar eclipses for thousands of years, however viewing an eclipse without protecting your eyes can cause retinal burns, also known as "eclipse blindness". This is due to the fact that the light from the sun is so intense that it can cause damage to your eye even if only a small sliver of it is exposed. Most people avoid looking directly at the sun, especially for extended periods of time yet try to look directly at solar eclipses because they believe that it won't be as bright.</p>

   <h2>Lunar Eclipse</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">A Lunar Eclipse occurs when the moon moves into the Earth's shadow, making it, the sun, and Earth aligned. A lunar eclipse is sometimes refered to as a "blood moon" because it causes the moon to look redish orange. This is caused by the way the sun's light reflects onto the moon while the planets are in syzygy. This event usually occurs about 2-3 times a year, and is more rare than a solar eclipse. Lunar eclipses can also last more than an hour, while solar eclipses only take minutes at most.<br><br>Unlike the dangers of staring into a solar eclipse, it is completely safe to look at a lunar eclipse. While the eclipse itself isn't harmful, it has many beliefs surrounding it that make some believe it to be a dangerous event. Some used to believe that a lunar eclipse turned all food and water poisonous, that bleeding persists longer during one, or that it could cause harm to a pregnant woman's baby.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:right;">Supermoon</h2>
    <p style="text-align:right;">The Moon orbits Earth elliptically and is closer or farther away at certain times, and a supermoon is essentially when the Moon is at its closest to Earth and is full. This means that the Moon appears bigger and brighter than it typically does. Although the Moons orbit is relatively predictable and it's at its closest or farthest point around the same time, having a full Moon at the same time that it's at its closest point of the orbit (also known as a perigee) is more rare; supermoons usually occur only 4-5 times a year.<br></br>Often, however, the supermoon will not appear significantly different in size and the difference is more noticeable when the Moon is closer to the horizon. But this does not mean that supermoons are an insignificant event! Due to the Moon's close proximity to the Earth, it can cause high and low tides to become more extreme. This is simply because the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth increases, therefore causing changes in the ocean waves and tides.<br><br><br><br></p>
